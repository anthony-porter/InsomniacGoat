# InsomniacGoat

### Concept
Create an application that makes it easier for NBA fans to decide who the greatest basketball player of all time is (G.O.A.T).

### Motivation
The motivation of this project is to be exposed to modern android frameworks, idioms, and design patterns that I don't get to use in my day job.

### Goals
  * Get more comfortable with MVVM in Android
  * Use Kotlin Coroutines
  * Use Room Database
  * Learn how to correctly use a repository
  * Get more comfortable with Kotlin
  * Learn more about databinding
  * Learn more about implementing dependency injection
### Challenges
* Finding a good API for NBA data.
* Finding resources for learning the basics
### Next Steps
1. Finish the API framework
2. Find a good way to mock the api
3. Implement the rest of the API
4. Find a good NBA API to replace mock API
5. Add dependency injection
6. Add unittests
7. Add Instrumentation tests (Robolectric + Espresso)

##### Running ideas, questions, spikes, etc.
* Can an HttpInterceptor be used to set the response for data mocking purposes?
  * Could said interceptor be used to read data from a file. what is the effort level?
